# Commerce Mesh Protocol (CMP) Registry

Welcome to the CMP Registry ‚Äî the decentralized index for brands and discovery nodes participating in the Commerce Mesh Protocol.

## What is This?
This registry defines the **minimum viable data format** to onboard an **organization (brand or seller)** into the CMP network. It adheres to the [schema.org](https://schema.org/Organization) standard and is extended with `cmp:` fields where necessary.

Participants are encouraged to provide full [schema.org](https://schema.org) payloads. However, **only a specific set of fields are required** to participate in CMP.


## üß† How This File Is Used
Each entry in the brand registry acts as a **decentralized profile** for a participating organization. Discovery nodes use this file to:
- **Identify** the organization and its brands
- **Locate** the canonical product feed endpoint
- **Filter** relevant brands by category, industry, or URNs

This file enables AI agents, marketplaces, and infrastructure partners to programmatically understand and transact with each brand without prior integration.



## üì¶ Required Fields for Organizations (Brands/Sellers)

Minimum required fields include:
- `@type`: Must be `Organization`
- `name`: Name of the organization
- `url`: Canonical URL of the organization
- `logo`: URL to organization logo
- `description`: Short description of the organization
- `identifier`: A nested object with a URN value under `cmp:orgId`
- `brand`: A nested `Brand` object with `name`, `logo`, and `identifier` (URN under `cmp:brandId`)
- `cmp:category`: One or more categories the organization operates in
- `cmp:productFeed.url`: Link to a well-known feed index JSON

## üì¶ Required Fields for Discovery Nodes
- `@type`: Must be `cmp:DiscoveryNode`
- `name`: Name of the discovery node
- `url`: Canonical service URL of the discovery node
- `cmp:description`: Short description of service scope or vertical focus
- `cmp:coverage`: List of `cmp:brandId` values or category paths covered
- `cmp:maintainer`: Name or organization running the node

## ‚úÖ Optional but Recommended
- `sameAs`: Array of social/profile links

## üß© Extending with Full Schema.org
You are welcome to include **full schema.org payloads** if your infrastructure already supports it. CMP will index required fields, and agents can optionally parse extended metadata.
